(d) Given two regular grammars G1 and G2, it is un-decidable whether L(G1)=L(G2)

Ans: d
Explanation:
Case (a):
The Halting Problem for TM is un-decidable problem. By un-decidable means no algorithm exist for it.

Case (b):
Ambiguity in a CFG is undecidable. No algorithm can decide if a CFG is ambiguous. By ambiguous means the CFG has two or more derivations for some sentence.

Case (c):
The equivalance problem of CFG's is undecideable. We have no algorithm to decide if two CFG's generate the same language.

Case (d):
The regular sets are a well behaved class of languages. Practically everything about Regular Language is decidable.

The printing problem of TMs is Undecidable. This can be reduce to the halting problem when the TM halts let it print something.

Case (c):
Multiplication, Addition can be done by TM so this is decidable.

(c) (ab*b + ba*a)* (a* + b*)
(d) (ba*a + ab*b)* (ab* + ba*)

Ans: d
Explanation:
Resolving the loops on A and solving A completely,

We get, rA = (ba*a + ab*b)*

Now, r = rB + rC = rA(ab* + ba*)

= (ba*a + ab*b)* (ab* + ba*)

Which is choice (d).

Q13. For Σ = {a, b}, let us consider the regular language L = {x | x = a^2+3k or x = b^10+12k, k ≥ 0}. Which one of the following can be a pumping length (the constant guaranteed by the pumping lemma) for L?

(a) 9
(b) 5
(c) 24
(d) 3

Ans: c
Explanation: According to the Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages, every string w present in the infinite regular language L should be divide into three parts w = xyz, where

(i) y ≠ ε

(ii) |xy| ≤ n , where n is some positive integer and |w| ≥ n

(iii) for every i ≥ 0, the string xyiz is also in L.

From the question,

when x = b10+12k

then minimum possible string is = b10 or 'bbbbbbbbbb'.

we cannot divide this into three parts x, y, z.

So pumping length should must be more than 10 so that we can divide any string into three parts.

(a) n
(b) n2
(c) 2n
(d) n(n+1)/2

Ans: d
Explanation:
Example:
Let w = GAT be a string then |w|= 3
The substrings possible are = { ε,G,A,T,GA,AT,GAT}
So,the substring of length 0 = 1 { the string is = ε }
the substring of length 1 = 3 { the strings are = G,A,T }
the substring of length 2 = 2 { the strings are = GA,AT }
the substring of length 3 = 1 { the strings are = GAT }
So total substrings for string length 3 are = (1 + 2 + 3) + 1
Similarly total substrings for string length n are = (1 + 2 + 3 + ................. n times) + 1 = (n(n+1)/2) + 1

Here substrings of length 0 is excluded.
So total substrings are = (n(n+1)/2).

(a) (i) and (ii)
(b) (ii) and (iii)
(c) (i) and (iii)

Q58. Consider the following languages:

L1={ww|w∈{a,b}∗}
L2={a^nb^nc^m|m,n≥0}
L3={a^mb^nc^n|m,n≥0}

Which of the following statements is/are FALSE?

(a) L1 is not context-free but L2 and L2 are deterministic context-free.
(b) Neither L1 nor L2 is context-free.
(c) L2, L3 and L2 ∩ L3 all are context-free.
(d) Neither L1 nor its complement is context-free.

Ans: b,c,d
Explanation:
L1={ww|w∈{a,b}∗}
L2={anbncm|m,n≥0}
L3={ambncn|m,n≥0}

L1 is not context free because it has string matching in straight order, which PDA cannot do.
L2 and L3 are clearly DCFL's, since they have only one comparison and DPDA can accept both.

(a) is therefore true.
(b) is false since L2 is DCFL and every DCFL is a CFL.
(c) is false because L2 ∩ L3 = {anbncn | n ≥ 0} is not a CFL.
(d) is false because complement of "ww" has CFG and is CFL.

Q59. Consider the following languages:

L1 = {a^nwa^n | w ∈ {a, b}*}
L2 = {wxw^R | w, x ∈ {a, b}*, | w | , | x | > 0}

Note that wR is the reversal of the string w. Which of the following is/are TRUE?

(a) L1 and L2 are regular.
(b) L1 and L2 are context-free
(c) L1 is regular and L2 is context-free.
(d) L1 and L2 are context-free but not regular.

Ans: a,b,c
Explanation:
L1 = {a^nwa^n | w ∈ {a, b}*}
L2 = {wxw^R | w, x ∈ {a, b}*, | w | , | x | > 0}

L1 is regular because by putting n = 0, we create a subset {w | w∈ {a, b}*} which contains all possible strings. So if subset of L1 is (a + b)*, then L1 = (a b)*.
L2 is regular because by putting w as "a" and "b" we get a regular expression a(a + b)+a + b(a + b)+b, which covers all other string which can be obtained by putting w as "a", "ab", "ba", "bb", etc.

So, L2 = a(a + b)+a + b(a + b)+b, which is regular.
So, L1 and L2 both are regular.
Now every regular is also context-free.
So, option (a), (b), (c) are all true and option (d) is false.

Q109. Which of the following is/are undecidable?

(b) Given a Turing machine M, decide if L(M) is regular.
(c) Given a Turing machine M, decide if M accepts all strings.
(d) Given a Turing machine M, decide if M takes more than 1073 steps on every string.

Ans: a,b,c
Explanation:
A, B, C choices are all non-trivial properties of RE language (language of TM's) and hence all UNDECIDABLE.

Choice (d) is DECIDABLE. Why?

A Turing Machine see only at most the first 1073 symbols of input in its first 1073 steps. Hence whether it stops on first 1073 steps depends only on the first 1073 symbols of input.
Since the number of strings of length 1073 is finite, it gives a way to decide this. Run the input machine M on all inputs of length 1073 and check whether any of them stops within 1073 steps. If so, reject, otherwise accept.

Q110. Which of the following statements is/are TRUE?

(a) Every subset of a recursively enumerable language is recursive.

(c) Complement of a context-free language must be recursive.
(d) If L1 and L2 are regular, then L1 ∩ L2 must be deterministic context-free.

Ans: b,c,d
Explanation:
(a) No language is closed under subset operation. So subset of an RE language may or may not be REC. So option (a) is false.

(b) If L and L― are both RE ⇒ L is REC is a theorem and is true.

(c) (CFL)C = (CSL)C = CSL

Every CSL is recursive.

So, complement of CFL is recursive is true.

(d) L1 → regular, L2 → regular

⇒ L1 ∩ L2 = Regular ∩ Regular = Regular

Now every regular language is a DCFL.

So, option (d) is true.
